# Swift_TrentSnaps
An iOS Snapchat clone storing data through Firebase.  This is using CocoaPods to import features into my apps, primarily Firebase.

This application mirrors the popular social networking app SnapChat.  Users can take a photo, add a description, and send the photo to a friend.
After the recipient views the photo and exits, the photo is deleted and no longer accessable.

The sign-in is simplified: users enter an email/password.  If the user already exists, they are signed in.  If not, TrentSnaps will create a user for them.
